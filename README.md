# Packaged version of Zotero and Juris-M.

These packages have been superseded by the [PPA packages](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-jurism-ppa). Remove the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/zotero.list`, and then follow the instruction on https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-jurism-ppa. This will replace your Zotero/Juris-M binaries -- it will *not* touch your Zotero library.
